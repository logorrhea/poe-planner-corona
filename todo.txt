make graph.lua use the scene architecture properly

hook back button up the camera (?) and make it function properly

get download.lua to actually download the necessary files

after downloading files, send user back to main menu

the POE website, rather than the hackneyed one that I put together (much of
this could probably be gleaned from the POESkillTree app code)
